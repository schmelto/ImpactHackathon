## The challenge

### All challanges of the #ImpactHackathon

1. **FoodWaste challenge hosted by [Schwarz Group](https://www.linkedin.com/company/schwarzdienstleistungen/):** How could food waste be reduced among consumers and retailers without endangering the prosperity of both parties?
2. **CampusLife challenge hosted by [Fraunhofer IAO](https://www.iao.fraunhofer.de):** How can data support finding the perfect residential neighborhood to live in?
3. **FutureEducation Challenge hosted by [Campus Founders](https://campusfounders.de/):** How can a combination of online and offline formats ensure equal opportunities in education?

### Our team has chosen:

**#CampusLife challenge hosted by [Fraunhofer IAO](https://www.iao.fraunhofer.de):** How can data support finding the perfect residential neighborhood to live in?


## Our idea

* [Some brainstorming](Ideas_Notes.md) (German)
* **Final idea - which we dealt with at the hackathon**:
  * creating an appartment search platform with the usage concept of modern dating platforms (swipe left and right)
  * but added the concept of two types of filter options:
    * **infrastructure filter options** with indication of importance (1-5) e.g. a fitness studio is very important to the user and he assigns 5 points in the filter options
    * **social filter options** like hobbies, where it would be great if the future roommates have them
  * the perfect offers are determined based on the filter parameters of the users
  * and the name is "finder"

**=> and "finder" has won the 2nd place in the #CampusLife challenge :boom:**


## Architecture

* Frontend: Angular + Angular Material
* Backend: Ruby + Cockroach DB




*Note: the finder-logo is just a parody.*
